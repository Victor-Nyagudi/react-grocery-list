# Grocery List

This is (technically) my first React app. The previous one I made I did so following along a tutorial,
however, this one was made mostly by myself whilst applying what I read in the docs.

It's quite similar to the the "legendary" to-do list, and I went ahead and used the SCSS that I've also
been working with recently. 

The main focus here wasn't styling or making things look good but applying the knowledge gained from
reading the docs. 

## Applied knowledge

In this app, I applied the following:

- Using forms in React
- Using state and updating it via `setState()`
- Working with components and composition
- Styling components using SCSS in React
- Conditionally rendering components
- Using class components and function components (I mixed both intentionally for learning purposes)
- Lifting state up
- Handling events

## Verdict

I found it quite difficult to grasp React's hierarchical nature at first. Knowing what gave what props to who, 
why nothing is being rendered to the DOM, as well as state and how it works were a couple of the things
that made it rather tough to understand.

After going through the docs multiple times (and a LOT of patience later), things are getting much clearer.
I knew front-end frameworks were crucial the more the project grew, but it only truly hit me while completing
the frontend mentor challenges for an e-commerce landing page and rock, paper, scissors game.

I found myself querying the DOM a lot for things and saving HTML templates inside the JavaScript files to render
to the DOM, and to be honest, things were starting to look and feel a bit messy. I knew at the back of my mind
that a tool exists that can make the entire process simpler and easier to read and maintain.

That being said, I might go back and redo those challenges this time with React, but nothing's set for now.
React and the functionality it provides via components, state, props, etc. should make working on bigger projects easier the more I get comfortable with it. 

I'm aware of the other heavyweights out there like Vue and Angular, but React is what I'll stick with for 
now until further notice. 

## Next Steps

Even though I've grown by leaps and bounds after understanding React concepts and making this simple project,
there's a lot more practice that needs to be done.

I understand hooks and have used them before, but I'd like to get even more practice with them. Furthermore, I
do intend to make a couple more smaller projects, God-willing. 

Here's to greater things!
